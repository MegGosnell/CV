[About me](#about-me)

## About me:

I am a highly motivated, enthusiastic post-graduate with a passion for tech and a thrill for problem solving. I'm not afraid of failure. In fact, I think it is an essential part of the experimental process that gets you to success when working in Software Development. I have A Levelâ€™s in Media studies, English Literature and Design as well as a 2:1 BA Politics Degree from Goldsmiths University.
With the technology industy being the fast moving pace of the new generation, I knew it was something I wanted to be a part of. I look forward to the new opportunities ahead, to continue bettering myself, and to continue developing my skills further.

My experience at Makers has fuelled my commitment of self development and has taught me not only how to write code but how to learn these skills, as well as key industry practices such as an agile development process and TDD.

I am looking forward to working in a creative industry along side a team of software engineers where I can continue to develop my coding skills and to grow further as a developer.
